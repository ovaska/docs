{{< blocks/cover title="About Precept" image_anchor="top" height="full" >}}

Precept was imagined by Warren Seymour after nearly a decade of refining integrations across fintech, first at AI Labs and then at Envestnet. It became clear through the course of building dozens of API integrations that there must be a more scalable way. The approach for Precept is informed by integrations across the leading fintech platforms and battle tested within the enterprise environment of Envestnet.

Today, the innovation continues with the support of Proof Partners, a technology consulting firm that fully owns Precept.
